## What is ORPMS?

This nodejs project is a opensource real estate property management system. 
A web application that offers a toolkit for owners of buildings, flats, offices, meeting rooms, car parks, letter boxes...

The idea is to make easy the management of properties and occupants by proposing many services:
 - Gather all information of your properties and occupants in one place
 - Create rent contract from templates available in the system
 - Follow the rent payments month by month
 - Template letters for recovery of not paid rents
